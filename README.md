- [Mithril Router](https://github.com/barneycarroll/mithril-router) - A Router component for Mithril in the vein of react-router, using universal-router & history. Designed for the browser. Light & assumptuous. (fork)
- [Universal Router](https://www.kriasoft.com/universal-router/) - A simple middleware-style router that can be used in both client-side and server-side applications.
- [History](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) - The history library lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript runs.
